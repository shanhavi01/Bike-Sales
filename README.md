# Bike-Sales
We have a bike sales dataset that includes bike ids, marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, cars, commute distance, region, age, and purchased bike.
First, data must be cleaned and extracted so that we can evaluate it across various fields, such as who purchased the most bikes based on gender (male or female), and so on. 
Use charts to demonstrate the analysis.
