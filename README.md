# Bike-Sales
This is a bike sales dataset that includes bike ids, marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, cars, commute distance, region, age, and purchased bike.
On this data set, we must analyse bike sales across various fields, such as who purchased the most bikes based on gender (male or female), and so on. Use charts to demonstrate the analysis.
