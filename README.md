# Bike-Sales
We have a bike sales dataset that includes bike ids, marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, cars, commute distance, region, age, and purchased bike.
First, data must be cleaned and extracted so that we can evaluate it across various fields, such as who purchased the most bikes based on gender (male or female), and so on. 
Use charts to demonstrate the analysis.
•	Income and Gender: The average income is higher for males who purchased a bike compared to females who purchased a bike.
•	Age Bracket: The analysis shows the count of customers who purchased a bike across different age brackets. The "Middle" age bracket has the highest count of bike purchases.
•	Marital Status: The analysis compares the count of bike purchases between married and single individuals.
•	Education Level: The analysis presents the count of bike purchases across different education levels, such as Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, Partial College, and Partial High School.
•	Region: The analysis displays the count of bike purchases across different regions, including Europe, North America, and the Pacific region.
•	Commute Distance: The analysis shows the count of bike purchases based on the commute distance, ranging from 0-1 Miles to More than 10 miles.
